# Airbnb Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The project also involves creating a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI.

## Skills and Tools
- Python scripting
- Data Preprocessing
- Visualization (Streamlit, GeoPandas, Folium)
- MongoDB Atlas
- Power BI

## Domain
Travel Industry, Property Management, and Tourism

## Problem Statement
The project objectives are to:
- Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
- Clean and prepare the dataset for accurate analysis.
- Develop a Streamlit web app with interactive maps to explore Airbnb listing distribution.
- Conduct price analysis and visualize variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
- Analyze availability patterns across seasons.
- Investigate location-based insights for specific regions or neighborhoods.
- Create interactive visualizations and dashboards for data exploration.

## Data Description
The Airbnb dataset includes structured data on listings, reviews, and users. Key attributes involve listing details, host information, geolocation, pricing, availability, amenities, and ratings.

## Methodology
1. **MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval:**
   - Connect to MongoDB Atlas to retrieve the Airbnb dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.

3. **Geospatial Visualization:**
   - Use Streamlit to create interactive maps for geospatial analysis.

4. **Price Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Analyze price variations and create dynamic visualizations.

5. **Availability Analysis by Season:**
   - Study occupancy rates and booking patterns across seasons.

6. **Location-Based Insights:**
   - Use MongoDB queries for location-specific insights.

7. **Interactive Visualizations:**
   - Develop visualizations to filter and drill down by user preferences.

8. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Build a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI.

## Learning Outcomes
- **MongoDB Atlas:** Store and retrieve data using a NoSQL database.
- **Streamlit:** Develop a web application for interactive exploration.
- **Python Data Analysis:** Data cleaning and visualization using Python.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Visualize spatial patterns with GeoPandas/Folium.
- **Power BI:** Create interactive dashboards for data presentation.
- **Data Cleaning/Preparation:** Ensure data quality and consistency.
- **Visualization Techniques:** Master techniques for effective communication.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Extract insights for data-driven decisions.
- **Collaboration and Project Management:** Manage and deliver project milestones.

## Usage
1. **Set up MongoDB Atlas:**
   - Create an account, set up a cluster, and load the Airbnb sample data.

2. **Run the Analysis:**
   - Clone this repository and install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`.

3. **Explore Dashboards:**
   - Use Tableau or Power BI to explore pre-built dashboards.
